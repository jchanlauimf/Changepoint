## Online Changepoint Detection
* [Online Neural Networks for Change Point Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01388v1.pdf)  
  Moments when a time series changes its behaviour are called change points. Detection of such points is a well-known problem, which can be found in many applications: quality monitoring of industrial processes, failure detection in complex systems, health monitoring, speech recognition and video analysis. Occurrence of change point implies that the state of the system is altered and its
timely detection might help to prevent unwanted consequences. In this paper, we present two online change-point detection approaches based on neural
networks. These algorithms demonstrate linear computational complexity and are suitable for change-point detection in large time series. We compare them
with the best known algorithms on various synthetic and real world data sets. Experiments show that the proposed methods outperform known approaches.
* [Bayesian Online Prediction of Change Points](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/bayesian-online-detection-and-prediction-of)  
Online detection of instantaneous changes in the generative process of a data sequence generally focuses on retrospective inference of such change points without considering their future occurrences. We extend the Bayesian Online Change Point Detection algorithm to also infer the number of time steps until the next change point (i.e., the residual time). This enables to handle observation models which depend on the total segment duration, which is useful to model data sequences with temporal scaling. The resulting inference algorithm for segment detection can be deployed in an online fashion, and we illustrate applications to synthetic and to two medical real-world data sets.
* [Detecting and Adapting to Irregular Distribution Shifts in Bayesian Online Learning](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/variational-beam-search-for-online-learning)
  We consider the problem of online learning in the presence of distribution shifts that occur at an unknown rate and of unknown intensity. We derive a new Bayesian online inference approach to simultaneously infer these distribution shifts and adapt the model to the detected changes by integrating ideas from change point detection, switching dynamical systems, and Bayesian online learning. Using a binary 'change variable,' we construct an informative prior such that--if a change is detected--the model partially erases the information of past model updates by tempering to facilitate adaptation to the new data distribution. Furthermore, the approach uses beam search to track multiple change-point hypotheses and selects the most probable one in hindsight. Our proposed method is model-agnostic, applicable in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings, suitable for an environment of concept drifts or covariate drifts, and yields improvements over state-of-the-art Bayesian online learning approaches.
